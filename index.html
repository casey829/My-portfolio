            <p class="intro">Hello,my name is <strong>Casey mwangi</strong> a 20year old student currently pursuing
                software
                development at
                moringa school.On the surface i think i am like most young and modern men.I have goals and dreams for
                the future that am determined to make happen.What makes me special is perhaps the uniqueness of being me
                which i believe is a big flex.</p>
            <p class="intro">At first it never occured to me that i would pursue software development as a career.It was
                trully love
                at first sight when my cousin introduced me to coding immediately after finishing my highschool at
                Oloolua Secondary School.When i wrote my first code and saw the result on my hompage browser i was
                really excited and it was at that moment i realised that this was the path i wanted and still want to
                walk through.What excites me most about coding is that you have the power to create something out of
                nothing and for a moment you feel like a <strong>'god'</strong> </p>
            <p class="end">I am naturally an introvert who prefers watching series,staying indoors,reading
                books,listening to music
                over going outside and socialising.I am currently aquiring skills on how to be a great software
                developer and am enjoying the game </p>
